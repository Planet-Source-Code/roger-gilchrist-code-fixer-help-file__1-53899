### Description

For latest Version 3+ change the 'txtCodeId=' number in the addressbar to 59248

File for v 2.9.7 New Fixes added. Check out improved Comments description page.

<p>This is the Help file for my Code Fixer Upload.

<p>Because it is large but doesn't change that much, I have decided to upload it seperately so that you don't have to download it every time I make a bug fix to the code.

<p>

----

<p>WARNING DO NOT USE CODE FIXER WITHOUT A COPY OF HELP<p>

----

<p>Not that it's hard coded (Code Fixer just tells you the help file is missing) but the program is a bit too powerful for 'poke it and see' use.

<p>

----

<p>Once you have a copy you need not update unless you wish. If there is a major change to Code Fixer that entails need for new help I will add a comment at the code Fixer page.
